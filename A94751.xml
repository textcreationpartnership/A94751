         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The tvvo Provoſt-Marſhals; viz. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Iohn Marſhall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Roger Quatermain,</hi> accompanied with ſome Divines, divers Troops of Horſe, and ſeverall companies of the Trained-Bands of the city of <hi>London,</hi> carryed Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Tompkins</hi> from <hi>Newgate</hi> on foot to <hi>Holborn,</hi> and juſt againſt <hi>Fetterlane</hi> end was erected a Gibbet; and Mr. <hi>Tompkins</hi> being upon the Ladder, in the ſight and preſence of many thouſands of Citizens, the Confeſsion he made, was as followeth:</head>
            <p>GEntlemen, I do humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the ſight of Almighty God, (to whom, and to Angels, and to this great aſſembly of people, I am now a ſpectacle) that my ſins have deſerved of him, this untimely and ſhamefull death, and I humbly ſubmit to it; And ſeeing all our times are in his hand, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155285:3"/>that a Sparrow fals not to the ground, but within his providence, much more Man that bears his image: I am no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, but do acknowledge Gods great protection to me, and his goodneſſe, and his mercy to me, in that he hath during all this trouble I have undergone, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved my heart, and kept it from ſin, and from thoughts of diſtraction, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his great mercie: I am no Papiſt, I muſt tell you, why I ſhall ſpeak a little of this, becauſe I have bin deſir'd by a good friend, an ancient friend of mine, to declare my ſelf in this point, and therefore I ſhall ſay ſomewhat to you of this, I ſay that I was never Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, nor popiſhly inclin'd, and for ſome relations I have had to ſome that way, I did never make any ſhew of the leaſt inclination to Papiſme; I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155285:3"/>had conference, and diſputes with ſome known Ieſuits in forraign parts chiefly; I thank God my Principles of Religion were ſo grounded, they could never ſhake me; I have been called by ſome of them a Heretique in grain. But this is true (which might make that worthy friend of mine put me in minde to cleer my ſelf, in this point) in regard of ſome relations, &amp; in regard I received very civil uſage from thoſe of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in forraign parts, where that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is profeſſ'd; I returned the like ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilneſſe to them here that <hi>J</hi> had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſpecially to thoſe whom any civil affair brought into my converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And truly <hi>J</hi> ſpeak this, if <hi>J</hi> were to live, <hi>J</hi> ſhould do the ſame thing, having no calling to the contrary; if <hi>J</hi> were an Officer it were ſomewhat.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:155285:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>J</hi> do forgive all the world, as <hi>J</hi> deſire all the world ſhould forgive me.</p>
            <p>Touching the buſineſſe for which <hi>J</hi> ſuffer, I do acknowledge that affection to a Brother-in-Law, and affection and gratitude to the King, whoſe Bread <hi>J</hi> have eaten now above 22 yeers, I have been a Servant to Him 20 yeers, I have been a Servant to Him when He was a Prince, and ever ſince, it will be 23 yeers in Auguſt next; I confeſſe thoſe two Motives drew me into this fooliſh buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: I have often ſince declared to good friends, that I was glad it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, becauſe it might have occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned very ill conſequences; and truly I have repented, having any hand in it.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I thank God, God hath given me ſo good a heart, and ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of minde, as I was confident he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155285:4"/>would either take me out of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or he would be preſent with me, to aſsiſt me in bearing this trouble; That <hi>J</hi> do acknowledge this as a great mercy, either to take me away from the dayes of ſin, or to take me away from the evils of the time to come, which God avert; or to take me away from the infirmities of age now approaching upon me: I knovv not vvhat more to ſay.</p>
            <p>Then turning to the Executioner, he ſaid:</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>HOneſt Friend, J forgive you, as the Executioner of juſtice, J forgive you. And I do recommend my ſelf to the hands of God Almighty; And one thing, pray give me leave to ſay, I hope to be ſaved onely by Faith in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p> 
            </q>
            <p>Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Waſhborn</hi> asked Maſter <hi>Tompkins</hi> this Queſtion, <hi>Do you acknowledge this your ſuffering to be juſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:155285:5"/>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Tompkins</hi> anſwered, <hi>I have ſaid it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, pray do not trouble me.</hi>
